## When is the next release available?

**There is no fixed release schedule for TeXStudio.**

The added features have to be **complete** and sufficiently **tested**.

*Since it's a project we develop completely in our spare time,*<br>
*the time we can invest may strongly vary and therefore it's*<br>
*hard to predict release dates.*

If you are interested in the latest features,<br>
you can try a development version

**No Warranty For Stability And Correctness**

### Builds

We provide **development snapshots** with every commit.

For [OSX] and [Windows] builds are provided on `bintray.com`.

For **Ubuntu** a [Development PPA] is set up.

**Linux** users can easily [Compile TeXStudio]  themselves.
