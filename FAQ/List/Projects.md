## TeXStudio Projects

**TeXStudio** supports project like editing implicitly,<br>
meaning you don't have a project configuration file.

#### Relations

A project is comprised of the files that refer to each<br>
other, may it be `includes`, `imported packages`,<br>
`user commands`, `labels` or `bibliographies`.

#### Limitations

By default **TeXStudio** will only load & parse files that have been opened.

However, you can active automatic inclusion via:<br>
`Options › Editor › Automatically load included files`

*This* ***may*** *impact performance for large projects*
